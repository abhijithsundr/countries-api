## What is it

A NodeJS API that can be hosted on a server to fetch required data for countries, states and associated cities.

## Motivation
Initially when I tried to use a library in react to fetch all the countries, states and cities, it worked just fine. The problem was that the size of the libraries - because they containted huge amounts of data, inadvertantly that led to larger buddle size.
Instead, I decided to make an API out of the library that can be hosted indipendentaly and the required data can be requested only when required.

What's more? This API hosted once can be used across multiple applications.

## Running the API
You are adviced to make tweaks to the the condiguration, it uses basic node.js and express, but you can be make it into a LOT more. ðŸ”®

```node index.js``` will build and start the dev server.

## Contribution
Feel free to add additional endpoints if required or open an issue and I'll look into it. Cheers ðŸ¤Ž
